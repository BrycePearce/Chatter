# Chatter
A chat website created as an excuse to learn Golang

I used the following resources to reference as a base:

https://dinosaurscode.xyz/go/2016/07/17/go-websockets-tutorial/
https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/12/create-real-time-chat-app-golang-angular-2-websockets/

And integrated my own changes to create this project.
